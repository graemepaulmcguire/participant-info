# **Gaelic Articulation Study: Participants Needed**

---

## **1. About the Project**

The main goal of this research is to examine how the articulators move during speech and the coordination between them. These movements will be recorded using [**electromagnetic articulography (EMA)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_articulography) and [**ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound_tongue_imaging).
  
Most articulatory data of this kind comes from widely spoken languages such as English and Mandarin Chinese. Including Gaelic helps to address this imbalance by incorporating data from a minority language that has received very little instrumental study. It also provides an opportunity to document Gaelic articulatory patterns in greater detail.

In addition to contributing to our understanding of how speech sounds are produced, I hope that this work can, in some small way, contribute to the preservation of Gaelic — whether by increasing its visibility in academic research or by providing findings that might eventually be of use in language teaching and revitalisation efforts.

## **2. Who I Am and Why I’m Doing This**
  
My name is Paul McGuire, and I’m doing my PhD through a cotutelle programme between National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan and Macquarie University in Australia. I finished a Masters in Linguistics a couple of years ago, and my primary area of research is phonetics. I’ve been given the opportunity to do a PhD research project in phonetics, and I want to focus on Gaelic, a language I am interested in both linguistically and personally.
  
I’m originally from the outskirts of Glasgow (although I moved to the north of England a few months before I turned twelve). My gran was a native speaker from Skye, so I often heard Gaelic spoken around me while I was growing up. Like most people of my generation, I didn't pick any up (apart from the odd word) and didn't really see the relevance of the language at the time. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve become increasingly interested in the language and have been self-studying, mostly using free resources like SpeakGaelic and LearnGaelic,  _Speaking Our Language_ and _Can Seo_ on YouTube, in addition to Michael Bauer's _Blas na Gàidhlig_ and William Lamb's _A Comprehensive Grammar_. 

Originally, I had planned to focus my PhD on a language I had previously studied from an articulatory perspective, such as L2 English, Vietnamese, or a Formosan language, building on the research I had done during my Master’s. However, after some thought, I realised that I really wanted to combine my interest in Gaelic with my research. Although a PhD project on Gaelic articulation is ambitious and comes with logistical challenges, I believe it will be a worthwhile undertaking.

## **3. Participants**

For the first phase of the study, we are particularly hoping to work with native speakers of  Gaelic.

By _native speaker_, we mean:

- You learned Gaelic from one or more of your parents or caregivers during childhood.
    
- You continue to use Gaelic in daily life, for example with family, friends, or in your community.
    
I'm aware that the term "native speaker" can be a bit problematic, and I don't mean to imply that any speaker is "better" or "more authentic" than another. The reason studies like this recruit people who learned Gaelic from their parents is that there may be slightly different articulatory characteristics associated with this group, even in comparison to people who speak very fluently but learned later. In later phases of the study, I also hope to include people who have gone through Gaelic-medium education or who have learned Gaelic to fluency.

## **4. What Participation Will Involve**

If you decide to take part:

- **Electromagnetic articulography (EMA):** You will read aloud words and sentences in Gaelic while small sensors are attached to your tongue, lips, and jaw (this can feel a bit strange to begin with but it’s not painful). These sensors are connected by thin wires to a recording system that tracks your articulatory movements in real time.
    
- **Ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI):** For this part, a small ultrasound probe will be placed under your chin to capture tongue movements while you read aloud sentences in Gaelic.
    
- Participants will receive a small nominal payment in appreciation of their time.

I understand that the vast majority of native Gaelic speakers were not taught to read or write Gaelic in school. While the study involves reading aloud words and sentences, this is not a barrier to participation. For each sentence, you’ll be repeating the same structure with just one word changing. We can display the word in Gaelic orthography, or if it’s easier, show a picture on the screen to remind you of the word.

I also want to emphasise that if you learned Gaelic from your parents and spoke it as a child, your Gaelic is considered native, even if your dialect differs slightly from someone else’s. There is no right or wrong — the study is purely about how the words are articulated in your dialect — it’s not a test. You’ll simply be repeating sentences while we record your speech.

Finally, I realise that many native speakers of Gaelic don’t live on the mainland. If you’re able to take part, I will do my best to come to you and, where possible, coordinate sessions with other speakers in your community — for example, at your home, workplace, or a nearby community centre. I’m exploring different options to make participation as easy as possible for everyone who wants to take part.
