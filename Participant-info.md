#    Gaelic Articulation Study: Participants Needed

---

## Who I am and Why I'm Doing This

My name is Paul McGuire, and I’m doing my PhD through a cotutelle programme between National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan and Macquarie University in Australia. I finished a Masters in Linguistics a couple of years ago, and my primary area of research is phonetics. I’ve been given the opportunity to do a PhD research project in phonetics, and I want to focus on Gaelic, a language I am interested in both linguistically and personally.

I'm originally from just outside of Glasgow, but I moved to the north of England a few months before I turned twelve. As a kid I was actually exposed to quite a bit of Gaelic. My gran was a native speaker from Skye and spoke Gaelic on the phone with her mum every day and with family from Skye and Fort William when they came down to visit. Unfortunately, I didn’t pick up any of the language apart from the odd word — I remember learning *Alba*, *preas* and *damhan-allaidh* for some reason. The closest I ever got to speaking Gaelic was occasionally mimicking the cadence of my gran’s voice and making a bunch of *guttural* sounds, which I must have thought was pretty funny at the time. I remember thinking it was a silly language for old people and wondering why anyone would bother with it when they could just speak English. Anyway, suffice it to say that my position on the matter has changed a bit since then, and over the past couple of years I've been trying to at least get to grips with the basics. 

The main goal of this study is to see how the articulators move during speech — particularly where they move and how they coordinate. We’ll be recording these movements using [**electromagnetic articulography (EMA)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_articulography) and [ **ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound_tongue_imaging) .

Most articulatory data of this kind comes from widely spoken languages such as English and Mandarin Chinese. Including Gaelic in this kind of research is important not only to ensure that minority languages are represented in the wider literature, but also as a way of documenting the language instrumentally. Through this project, I hope to contribute to our understanding of speech production, and also, in some small way, to the preservation of Gaelic and its visibility in research.

##  Participants

For the first phase of the study, we are particularly hoping to work with **native speakers of  Gaelic**.

By _native speaker_, we mean:

- You learned Gaelic from one or more of your parents or caregivers during childhood.  
- You continue to use Gaelic in daily life, for example with family, friends, or in your community.  

In a later phase, we also hope to include participants who have gone through **Gaelic-medium education** or speak Gaelic fluently. The distinction is only for practical reasons: we start with native speakers to establish a baseline for the study.

## What Participation Will Involve

If you decide to take part:

- **Electromagnetic articulography (EMA):** You will read aloud words and sentences in Gaelic while small sensors are attached to your tongue, lips, and jaw (this can feel a bit weird to begin with but it's not painful). These sensors are connected by thin wires to a recording system that tracks your articulatory movements in real time.
    
- **Ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI):** For this part, a small ultrasound probe will be placed under your chin to capture tongue movements while you read aloud words and sentences in Gaelic.
        
- Participants will receive a small nominal payment in appreciation of their time.

I understand that the vast majority of native Gaelic speakers were not taught to read or write Gaelic in school. While the study involves reading aloud words and sentences, this is not a barrier to participation. For each sentence, you’ll be repeating the same structure with just one word changing. We can display the word in Gaelic orthography, or, if it's easier, show a picture on the screen to remind you of the word.

I also want to emphasise that if you learned Gaelic from your parents and spoke it as a child, your Gaelic is considered native, even if your dialect differs slightly from someone else’s. There is no right or wrong  — the study is purely about how you articulate words — it's not a test. You’ll simply be repeating sentences while we record your speech.

Finally, I realise that many native speakers of Gaelic don’t live on the mainland. If you’re able to take part, I will find a way to come to you and try to coordinate it, ideally alongside other speakers in your community — for example, by bringing the equipment to your home, workplace, or a nearby community centre. I’m exploring different options to make sure that anyone who wants to participate can do so.

## Safety

Electromagnetic articulography and ultrasound tongue imaging are **biologically safe** and **non-invasive** methods.

- There are **no documented adverse health effects**.  
- For EMA, the main discomfort is minor: the sensors are temporarily attached inside the mouth using non-toxic adhesive and may take a few minutes to get used to.
